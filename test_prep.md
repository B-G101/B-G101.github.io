#### 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
     - Creative Commons license allows everything to be in the open and shared. This makes it harder to patent if you are a business. This license gives the author the freedom to share their work with the understanding that it will be accesible and sharable to all people. This license is more open and allows works to be distributed and modified. 
     - The MIT license allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. The license is both business friendly and open source friendly. 
     - Patents and open source battle each other because it is harder to get a patent with an open source license.
     - It has to be a balance because business without income will not survive and using creative commons and open source content is free
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
     - Our group decided on the Creative Commons license because we want our website to be accesible to other teams who want to create a similar website for their sports team. We also feel like it made the most sense because we aren't monetizing anything on our website and we intend for the website to be more sharing based. 

#### 5.6 Safe Computing
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
     - Some PII that has been in CompSci Principles has been our emails and names. When we made the database we had to be in our emails and name and phone number. Some informatoin that might be linked is our birthday or family depending on the other information we put on our about me pages.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
     - I think that since everything is so digital now that it is going to be way harder to keep general personal information secure like your address or email. Though I do have social media, I don't think I'm thaat over exposed because I don't really post much and don't use the location feature.
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
     - A good password has a mixture of numbers and characters that is hard for the average person or algorithm to guess. A bad password has easy to identify words or number combinations in it like "password" or "123" or "ABC". Another step used to assist in authentication would be having a code sent to another device or email to ensure that you can log into your account. 
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
     - Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data making it very easy to use. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt information.
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
     - An example of encryption that is used in deployment is 
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
     - One phising scheme that I've seen is that when you illegally watch movies on 123 movies, a lot of the ads tell you to click on a link to watch the movie. The is a scam because it will lead you to another page to potentially get hacked or gt your information stolen. Some other examples of phising techniques could be getting emails telling you to click a link. Or getting DMs telling you to click a link.

#### 5.3 Computing Bias
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

     - I do not think that the owner of this computer thoght that this was intentional. The tone of the video was very comical which leads me to believe that the computer owner was just shocked that something like this was happening on his computer. I think the computer owner was also confused as to the error that was happening on the computer, but it does not seem like he believed that HP was being malicious in nature. 
     
2. How do you think this happened?

     - I think this was caused by a lack of diverse testing. The HP team probably only tested this facial tracking feature on lighter skin individuals, so when the product as distributed, it had only been programmed for one type of person.
     
3. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

     - This is harmful because it excludes an entire group of people from using the program. If the computer is meant for everyone, then having this programmed biases prevents the computer from achieving its goal. I don't think that it was intended to exclude people or cause harm to any group of people. I thiknk that the HP team just didn't test the computer on a large enough group of diverse individuals. 
     
4. Should it be corrected?

     - This error should be correced because it is preventing the computer from being a universally used product.
     
5. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

     - To produce a better outcome, we should make sure that we are testing new computer features with a diverse group of people from different backgrounds. 

#### 5.4 Crowdsourcing
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

     - A crowdsourcing idea for CSP students could be that after each product, we should get to share our code to our crossover group from the past project. That way we get to understand the various ways there are to solve a computing problem. We would also get to check our answers with other people. This could be started by including it with our crossover reviews. 
     
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

     - An idea for crowdsourcing at Del Norte could get getting students to give their opinion at the end of each year about the classes that they've taken. Then there would be a website that could display all the information gotten from students. That way other students could get input from sutdents who have already taken the classes they want to take. I think our finally project could be better with crowdsourcing to get photos from parents that they have from the lacrosse games to add to our gallery.

#### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

   - A possible beneficial effect of computing would be that it gives more people access to research information which is used a lot for research papers and other educational reasons. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that it can give people too much information and sometimes the information that people recieve is not accurate. 
   - Another possible beneficial effect of computing would be that it allows people to connect to one another and not have to be in the same location to do so. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that using social media to connect can lead to some harmful things like cyberbullying or cancel culture. 
   - Another possible beneficial effect of computing would be that you can store information in a digital format rather than having to use paper. Store information digitally also allows for people to be more organized and keep their files in an easily accessible place. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that store information online could cause a security issue for people and hackers could access their files.

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

   - I think that the dopamine issues that were described above are very real because of the amount of people that are addicted to their phones. I think that for me personally, being on my phone when I should be doing homework is something that hinders my sucess sometimes. 

#### 5.2 Digital Divide

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

   - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by seeking out information for themselves and consulting a variety of sources. A person can also empower themselves by trying to get access to internet connection or having a location that they can use a computer at.


3. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

   - Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by teaching and educating them about tech. They can also empower others by sharing their resources with the people who are not empowered. Something I could do would be encouraging more people to take CS/any computer related class or to learn about tech to decrease the digital divide.
5. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

   - To a certain extend I think that red tape blocking might hinder empowerment to a certain degree as it might prevent people from getting the information they need to empower themselves. It could also be important for keeping the user safe as well. These barriers do exist at Del Norte in the form of blocked websites on the school's wifi.
