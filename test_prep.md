#### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

   - A possible beneficial effect of computing would be that it gives more people access to research information which is used a lot for research papers and other educational reasons. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that it can give people too much information and sometimes the information that people recieve is not accurate. 
   - Another possible beneficial effect of computing would be that it allows people to connect to one another and not have to be in the same location to do so. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that using social media to connect can lead to some harmful things like cyberbullying or cancel culture. 
   - Another possible beneficial effect of computing would be that you can store information in a digital format rather than having to use paper. Store information digitally also allows for people to be more organized and keep their files in an easily accessible place. A possible harmful effect of computing would be that store information online could cause a security issue for people and hackers could access their files.

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

   - I think that the dopamine issues that were described above are very real because of the amount of people that are addicted to their phones. I think that for me personally, being on my phone when I should be doing homework is something that hinders my sucess sometimes. 

#### 5.2 Digital Divide

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

   - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by seeking out information for themselves and consulting a variety of sources. A person can also empower themselves by trying to get access to internet connection or having a location that they can use a computer at.


3. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

   - Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by teaching and educating them about tech. They can also empower others by sharing their resources with the people who are not empowered. Something I could do would be encouraging more people to take CS/any computer related class or to learn about tech to decrease the digital divide.
5. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

   - To a certain extend I think that red tape blocking might hinder empowerment to a certain degree as it might prevent people from getting the information they need to empower themselves. It could also be important for keeping the user safe as well. These barriers do exist at Del Norte in the form of blocked websites on the school's wifi.
